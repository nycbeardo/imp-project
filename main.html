                        <h3>Gustave Courbet and The Challenge to Official Art</h3>

                        <p>The Realist movement, championed by Gustave Courbet, first confronted the official Parisian art establishment in the middle of the nineteenth century. Courbet was an anarchist that thought the art of his time closed its eyes on
                            realities of life. The French were ruled by an oppressive regime and much of the public was in the throes of poverty. Instead of depicting such scenes, the artists of the time concentrated on idealized nudes and glorious depictions
                            of nature. In his protest, Courbet financed an exhibition of his work right opposite the Universal Exposition in Paris of 1855, a bold act that led to the emergence of future artists that would challange the status quo.</p>

                        <h3>Exhibitions in Paris and The Salon des Refusés</h3>
                        <p>In 1863, at the official yearly art salon, the all-important event of the French art world, a large number of artists were not allowed to participate, leading to public outcry. The same year, the Salon des Refusés ("Salon of the
                            Refused") was formed in response to allow the exhibition of works by artists who had previously been refused entrance to the official salon. Some of the exhibitors were Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, James Whistler, and the
                            early iconoclast Édouard Manet. Although promoted by authorities and sanctioned by Emperor Napoleon III, the 1863 exhibition caused a scandal, due largely to the unconventional themes and styles of works such as Manet's Le
                            déjeuner sur l'herbe (1863), which featured clothed men and naked women enjoying an afternoon picnic (the women were not classical depictions of a nude, but rather women that took off their clothes).</p>

                        <h3>Édouard Manet and the Painting Revolution</h3>
                        <p>Édouard Manet was among the first and most important innovators to emerge in the public exhibition scene in Paris. Although he grew up in admiration of the Old Masters, he began to incorporate an innovative, looser painting style
                            and brighter palette in the early 1860s. He also started to focus on images of everyday life, such as scenes in cafés, boudoirs, and out in the street. His anti-academic style and quintessentially modern subject matter soon
                            attracted the attention of artists on the fringes and influenced a new type of painting that would diverge from the standards of the official salon. Similar to Le déjeuner sur l'herbe, his other works such as Olympia (1863)
                            gave the emerging group ideas to depict that were not previously considered art worthy.</p>

                        <h3>French Cafés and Diversity</h3>
                        <p>One of the popular venues for the individuals that were to become the Impressionist to meet and discuss painting and art were Parisian cafés. In particular, Café Guerbois in Montmartre was frequented by Manet starting 1866. Renoir,
                            Bazille, Sisley, Monet, Degas, Cézanne, and Pissarro would come, while Caillebotte and Bazille had studios nearby and would often join the gatherings. Other personalities joined the creative group including writers, critics,
                            and the photographer Nadar, and most notably the writer Emile Zola that both added to the ethos of the group, and later championed their work in print. Part of the interesting dynamics of the group was the variety of personalities,
                            economic circumstances, and political views. Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro had lower and working class backgrounds while Morisot, Caillebotte, and Degas were from haute bourgeoisie roots. Mary Cassatt was American (and a woman)
                            and Alfred Sisley was Anglo-French. This diversity of personalities may be the reason so much success arose from all these individual, and group, efforts.</p>
